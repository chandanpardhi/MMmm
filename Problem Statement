Problem 1: 

Consider a two-class M/M/m/m system with preferential treatment for one class. There is a limit of
k < m on the number of circuits (servers) that can be used by sessions (customers) of second type, so there are always
m − k circuits for use by sessions of the first type. Take m = 50, k = 20, λ1 = 5 calls/min, λ2 = 7 calls/min,
1/µ1 = 4 min, and 1/µ2 = 3 min.


a) Write a computer program to obtain the call blocking probabilities of the two sessions, using the Erlang's formula.

b) Simulate the Poisson distributed arrival processes and exponentially distributed service times. (Recall that call
arrivals with exponentially distributed interarrival times follow Poisson distribution.) Obtain the blocking probabilities using the simulated call generation and service processes. Verify the results with those obtained in part(a).

c) Eliminate the condition of preferential treatment of one session, i.e., consider now k = m. However the arrival
and service rates remain as before. Obtain the blocking probability of the overall system using the discrete event
simulation approach developed in part (b). Compare the result with those obtained in part (b). 

d) Vary m from 20 to 60 in 8 steps and obtain the graphical plot of system call blocking probability versus number
of circuits (m) for the system in part (c). Also mark the blocking probabilities at different m obtained using the
analytic expressions in part (a) in the same graph to verify how they match with your simulated results.
